# My Compilist

## React web app designed to explore movies, shows, and books

### Purpose
My Compilist is designed to explore the latest and most popular movies, shows, and books with ease. Trailers and IMDb links can be accessed effortlessly to make informed viewing decisions.

But that's not all - users can personalize their experience by creating an account. Login functionality is provided to curate personalized lists, categorizing movies users already enjoyed and those on their must- watch list.

This React app makes the use of "TMDB" and "Open Library" APIs to access data on movies, shows, and books. User's personalized data is stored in a Mongoose database which is handled thorugh a Node.js app (mongooseConnections repository in my list of repos) on the backend.

The web app can be visted at [https://mycompilist.com/](https://mycompilist.com/)

* Access the most popular movies, shows, and books
